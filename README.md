## Practice building a RESTful API in Golang:

The goal of this project was to practice building a RESTful API in Go with a PostgreSQL database.
I also wanted to experiment with a couple 3rd party packages to generate JWTs and to encrypt/decrypt passwords with Argon2. This was originally part of one of my private repositories, so I did not want to post information on the database schema.

Other learning points were:
* Practice with concurrency in Go
* Practice deploying server with Docker and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

*I am currently in the process of adding more tests!*
